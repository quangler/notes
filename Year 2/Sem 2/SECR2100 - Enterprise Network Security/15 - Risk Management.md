**Risk** - possibility of suffering harm or loss
**Risk Management** - overall decision-making process of:
- identifying threats / vulnerabilities - what they can impact
- determining the costs to mitigate problems
- deciding what actions are cost effective for controlling risks
**Risk Assessment / Analysis** - process of:
- analyzing an environment to identify the risks
- determining the mitigation actions of an event that would affect project / program / business
**Asset** - resource / information an organization needs to conduct its business
**Impact** - the loss / harm resulting when a threat exploits a vulnerability

**Threat** - any circumstance or even with the potential to cause harm to an asset
**Threat actor (agent)** - the entity behind the threat
**Threat vector** - is a method use to effect a threat
**Vulnerability** - characteristic of an asset that can be exploited by a threat to cause harm

**Control** - a measure taken to detect, prevent, or mitigate the risk associated with a threat
- aka **Countermeasure** or **safeguard**
(KNOW THIS) **Qualitative risk assessment** - process of *subjectively* determining the impact of a risk
(KNOW THIS) **Quantitative risk assessment** - process of *objectively* determining the impact of a risk

**Single loss expectancy (SLE)** - monetary loss or impact of each occurrence of a threat exploiting a vulnerability
**Exposure factor** - measure of the magnitude of loss of an asset - used in calculation of single loss expectancy
**Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)** - frequency that an event is expected to occur per year
**Annualized loss expectancy** - how much an event is expected to cost per year

(KNOW THIS) **Systematic Risk** - chance of loss that is predictable under relatively stable circumstances (fire, flood - things that can be planned for)
(KNOW THIS) **Unsystematic Risk** - chance of loss that is unpredictable in the aggregate because it results from forces difficult to predict (covid, war - things that can't really be planned for)
**Hazard** - is a circumstance that increases the likelihood or probable severity of a loss

If managers are doing nothing - risk will be increased since no one cares
Today, risk is split into two categories:
- **Business Risk**
	- examples:
	- treasury management - company holdings
	- revenue management - generation of revenue
	- contract management - customer / vendor / partner contracts
- **Technology Risk** - (a subset of business risk)
	- examples:
	- Security and Privacy - protecting personal / private / confidential information
	- Information Technology Operations - day-to-day operations, are things breaking etc.
	- Business systems control and effectiveness - manual / automated controls that safeguard company assets and resources

**Risk Mitigation Strategies**
User rights / permissions
change management
incident management
audits
technology controls

**Data loss or theft**
Data is primary target of most attackers
- To prevent:
	- data minimization - not storing what isn't needed

**Risk Management Models**
- can be applied to managing risks in general - (this is the one we looking at for this class)
- can be tailed for managing software projects
(KNOW THIS) Following steps:
1. Asset Identification
	- identify and classify assets, systems, processes that need protection because they are vulnerable 
2. Threat Assessment
	- identifying threats and possible vulnerabilities
3. Impact Determination and Quantification
	- when a threat happens - turns a risk into an impact
		- tangible impact - financial loss or physical damage
		- intangible impact - hard to assign financial data
4. Control Design and Evaluation
	- determining what controls to put in place to mitigate risks
		- controls - designed to reduce vulnerabilities
		- preventive controls - designed to prevent the vulnerability from causing an impact
		- detective controls - detects a vulnerability that has been exploited so that action can be taken
5. Residual Risk Management - **REMEMBER THIS ONE**
	- risk can't be fully eliminated
	- risks that are still there after implementing controls is a **residual risk**
	- you further evaluate residual risks to identify where additional controls are required to reduce risk even more

### Qualitatively Assessing Risk
- using expert judgement and experience to assume a possible vulnerability
- compare impact of the threat with the probability of occurrence

| high impact / low prob | high impact / high prob |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| low impact / low prob  | low impact / high prob  |

### Quantitatively Assessing Risk
- using historical information and trends to attempt to predict future performance
	- gathering data for this information can be difficult
	- you can turn qualitative into quantitative (with some crazy formula we don't need to know)

### Qualitative vs Quantitative
- impossible to conduct risk management purely on quantitative
- usually include both
- possible to accomplish purely qualitative
### Cost Effectiveness Model
- assumes you are incurring a cost - focuses on this cost
- **total cost of ownership (TCO)** - set of all costs, capital costs, operational costs, exception-handling costs
- goal is to minimize TCO
### Risk Management Best Practices
- ensure the business has the set of best practices to cover its operational responsibilities
- minimally include business continuity, high availability, fault tolerance, disaster recovery concepts
for best practices, need to:
- understand vulnerabilities
- understand threat vectors / likelihoods of occurrence
- use of mitigation techniques to reduce residual risk to manageable levels
