## Introduction
This is a brief guide explaining how to sign in and use work utilities, specifically RDWeb.
To start, it is a good idea to identify if you are using a Remote Desktop Services (RDS) or a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) deployment.
RDS is typically used by users that don't need access to resource intensive tools like CAD or accounting software, whereas VDI is used for heavier application uses.

A quick and easy way to check if you are an RDS user is to do the following:

## How to check if you are a RDS user:
1. Click the windows button on your keyboard or on your task bar.

2. Now click the "All apps" button in the windows menu.

3. Now scroll down until you reach the W section. If you see "Work Resources (RADC)" you are an RDS user. <BR>You can either click on the folder and use your work apps from there, or use the RDWeb method which will be explained below.

4. If you don't see "Work Resources (RADC)" this most likely means you are not an RDS user, but don't worry, there is still a way for you to access your work resources.

## How to access work resources via RDWeb (VDI):
This section will inform you on how to access your work resources through RDWeb for a VDI user.

1. First, open a browser of your choice. In this case Microsoft Edge was used.

2. Next, copy the following in the search bar: `https://vdi.brunsco.sf/RDWeb`.

3. You will be greeted by a login page. Log in using the same credentials you use to sign in to your account on your work computer.<br>Be sure to put your username followed by `@brunsco.sf` in the username bar, this is the login that your account usually uses, but the `@brunsco.sf` is dropped because your physical computer automatically enters it for you.

4. Hit "Sign in" and you will be met with a page that should contain either a "VDI Pool" or a "VDI Private" icon on it. <br>In this case, the user has a "VDI Pool" icon, but the steps will be the same for either a "VDI Pool" or "VDI Private" icon.

If you sign in and have **no icon**, this could be a permission error for the account you signed in with, or you are an RDS user and need to follow slightly modified steps.<br>Go to the section titled "How to access work resources via RDWeb (RDS):" for more help.

5. Click on the icon and wait up to 30 seconds. A "Downloads" dropdown menu will open somewhere on the browser, for Microsoft Edge it will be in the top right.

6. Click on "Open file" under the downloaded file. It may give you a popup that lets you know that "the publisher of this remote connection can't be identified", "click "Connect".

7. It may ask you to re-enter your credentials, do so and then press "OK".
![[Pasted image 20240131205157.png]]

8. It will appear to sign you in to another computer, but there will be a small bar at the top indicating you have remotely accessed your virtual desktop.<br>This new computer will be where you can do your work, and will have any apps you may need.

## How to access work resources via RDWeb (RDS):
This is how to access your web resources if you are an RDS user.
1. Just like how the VDI walkthrough starts, open a browser of your choice. In this case Microsoft Edge was used.
![[Pasted image 20240131195120.png]]

2. Next, copy the following in the search bar: `https://rds.brunsco.sf/RDWeb`.
![[Pasted image 20240131204426.png]]

3. You will be greeted by a login page. Log in using the same credentials you use to sign in to your account on your work computer.<br>Be sure to put your username followed by `@brunsco.sf` in the username bar, this is the login that your account usually uses, but the `@brunsco.sf` is dropped because your physical computer automatically enters it for you.
![[Pasted image 20240131195709.png]]

4. Once logged in, you will see application icons, in this example we see Discord, Paint, Thunderbird, and WinRAR. <br>If you are coming from the VDI section and you still see nothing, contact your IT support.

5. Click on any of the icons you desire and wait for the "downloads" dropdown to show up. For Microsoft Edge it is in the top right.
![[Pasted image 20240131204843.png]]

6. Click on "Open file" under the downloaded file. It may give you a popup that asks if you trust the publisher of the RemoteApp, click "Connect".
![[Pasted image 20240131205046.png]]

7. It may ask you to re-enter your credentials, do so and then press "OK".
![[Pasted image 20240131205151.png]]

8. The app should now open. It will behave as if it is a local application on your machine. <br>The only difference between the local app and this remote app is the icon in the task bar having a circle with two green arrows pointing to each other.
