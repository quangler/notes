- HYBRID, EXCHANGE, TEAMS
- hybrid environment until teams (4, 5, 6)
- same length as last time, fewer written response
historically has broken 3/4 exams ??????????
- if something breaks in the exam - will be discarded 

- "easy gimmes"
- might not be fair question ! woohoo!!
**bulk of exam is exchange and teams**
- not applicable !!! WOOO!!!!
- a lot of true and false !?

know how to fire a user in hybrid environment
- secure the account
- block the sign ins
- disable the account
- lock them out (make sure they can't do anything in that 60 minute countdown)

challenges in administrating hybrid environments
- no central administration - azure portal, 3rd party, etc.
- authentication challenges - ADFS / Entra AD / SSO
- data governance - where does the data actually live
- end user training - where do end users save things (desktop, file server, SharePoint?)
- new users / terminated users - where do you create account, when do you disable, how do you terminate?


explain what Entra AD is
- cloud based identity management service - provides authentication / authorization
	- on prem AD - inverted tree structure (domain root, domain, OU/containers, sub OUs, users) - group / user based access
	- Entra AD - flat structure, no structure, groups and users at same level - **role based access**


know difference between M365 group and distribution group
**M365 Group**: used for collaboration between users. Include SharePoint, provides a group email and shared workspace
- think of this like a community group - has an email, collaboration tools

**Distribution Group**: used for sending email notifications to a group of people
- think of this like a mailing list - it sends emails to these people

troubleshooting question - scenario and policies - what's wrong
- that'll be tough

email aliasing & addressing - what the difference is between those
**Email Addressing** - the address that email is sent to and can be sent from (**SMTP:**)
**Email Aliasing** - the address that email can be sent to that will forward to the main address (smtp:)

exchange resource accounts - what they are used for - limitations | rooms and resources
**Rooms** - assigned to locations - used for letting users book them by bringing the room into a meeting. lets users use a shared calendar
**Equipment** - not assigned to locations, assigned to things - used for letting users book them by bringing the equipment into a meeting - lets users use a shared calendar
**Limitations** - only as good as the setup is - can only book things if there are resources available, and if the policy allows it. If there is someone in charge of delegation and they are out, that's tough.

defaults for teams and exchange - broad / common sense


know how to manage m365 and exchange environments - methods you can do so
on prem with powershell, in the cloud with `admin.microsoft.com` and exchange admin center

know mailbox types - functionality
**User Mailbox** - assigned to individual users - lets a user email, have contacts, book things, calendar
**Shared Mailbox** - configured exclusively for multiple users
**Resource Mailbox** - designed scheduling equipment / rooms
**Mail Contact** - contact that contains info about people or organizations outside of an exchange organization

know how to manage users - name changes, creations, deletions, etc.


know what is included in basic teams subscription
- up to 300 participants per meeting
- 10GB of cloud storage per user
- unlimited chat with coworkers and customers
- file sharing, tasks, polling
- data encryption for meetings, chats, calls, files
- hundreds of collaborative apps
- 





know theory behind exchange functionality
- resources, mailboxes inside of them
how hybridized environments work
- challenges - esp. old style domain names
general settings are
- common sense
admin challenges for cloud in general
being able to troubleshoot when things aren't working (given to you)
knowing what Entra ID is
the cloud-based identity management service - provides authentication / authorization
- challenges around it
	- flat structure, no structure - hard to navigate or know what the fuck is going on



typically highest averages on this test

will show us the potentially broken questions:
- if they do break, just skip

not a ton of written in this exam

pretty much all he can give us
