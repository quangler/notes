### SharePoint Online Overview
- included by default with all M365 licensing models (except app only licensing)
- provides all the same benefits of SharePoint on prem
- increased 3rd application integration with Microsoft SSO - things work better with SharePoint
- Workflow and process automation
SharePoint online admin center overhaul:
- site collections are no longer how sites are managed
- storage quotas are now managed automatically by default
- offline document library sync with OneDrive
- storage for all active sites is per tenant pool
SharePoint sites are automatically generated by New Teams or Group creation

#### Storage
- default storage pool capacity is 1.24TB (not per person, per tenant)
- can be increased per GB - $0.26 per GB
- SharePoint online automatically manages storage quotas unless disabled
- manual storage limits are a global setting once enabled all sites will inherent the maximum SharePoint site size of 25TB
#### Site Collection Replacement - (On-Prem)
All SharePoint sites in your tenant are managed from the active sites page
- site level sharing
- storage quota - IF automatic disabled
- site owners
- permissions
- policies
### OneDrive for Business Overview
- ***OneDrive for Business* is not the same as *OneDrive***
OneDrive acts as the front-end for SharePoint (OneDrive is what users sees, SharePoint is where the actual storage is)
- OneDrive for Business integrates and relies on SharePoint for storage and policy
- SharePoint is at the top of the hierarchy
- Global settings affect all users / individual settings are managed from the SharePoint admin center
#### OneDrive Layout
- each user is given their own SharePoint document library as their "personal" one drive space
- this library does not count towards the tenant 1.24TB total
- personal libraries are located at: `https://<tenantname>.sharepoint.com/personal/<username_tenantdomain>`
#### Offline file sync
- OneDrive handles all offline file syncing for personal OneDrive libraries as well as other SharePoint document libraries
90% of the tickets for this are from multiple users modifying a document at the same point - conflicts

### OneDrive Sharing
- external sharing must match SharePoint or be less permissive
OneDrive cannot exceed the permissiveness of SharePoint
4 settings:
- Anyone (shareable links are good)
- New and Existing external users (must sign in)
- Existing external users (only users already in the organization's directory)
- only people in your organization (no external sharing)
### SharePoint / OneDrive Migrations
