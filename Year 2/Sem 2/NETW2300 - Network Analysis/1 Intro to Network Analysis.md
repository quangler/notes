#### Network Analysis
The process of capturing and analyzing network traffic with the purpose of:
- identifying performance issues
- locate security breaches
- analyze application behavior
- perform capacity planning

#### Network Analyst
A network analyst has 3 basic skills:
- **a solid understanding of TCP/IP communications**
- familiarity with network traffic capturing and analyzing tools (Wireshark)
- familiarity with packet structures and typical packet flow
Network Analyst tasks while using Network Analysis:
- [[#Troubleshooting Tasks]]
- [[#Security Tasks]]
- [[#Optimization Tasks]]
- [[#Application Analysis Tasks]]
#### Analysis example
The typical network analysis session includes:
- capturing packets **at the appropriate location**
- apply filters to focus on traffic of interest
- review and identify anomalies in the traffic
##### Troubleshooting Tasks
Most common use of network analyzers - helps to find source of issue
- locates faulty devices
- identify devices or software misconfigs
- measure high delays along the path
- locate where packet loss occurs
- identify service refusals - closed protocol/port or deny on firewall
##### Security Tasks
Identify security scanning processes, breaches or holes in network. Can be proactive or reactive
- perform intrusion detection
- identify malicious traffic signatures
- discover hosts, services, OS (scanning)
- log traffic for forensics examination
- capture traffic as evidence
- test firewall blocking
##### Optimization Tasks
Analyzing current performance in contrast with desired capabilities and adjusting to reach optimal performance
- analyze current bandwidth usage
- evaluating response times across a network
- evaluating efficient use of packet sizes in data transfer applications
##### Application Analysis Tasks
Analyzing traffic generated by a network application
- analyzing application bandwidth requirements
- identifying application protocols and ports in use
- validating secure application data transmission
