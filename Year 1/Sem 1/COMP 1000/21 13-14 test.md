print device - the thing that actually does the printing

printer - icon, represents the driver, properties, perms

print spooler - monitors current print job and determines when something should be printed

print queue - virtual holding area for spooled jobs

  

print clients > print server > print devices

  

print clients - have a printer that points to print server

  

why print server

-centralized administration

-standard policies for printing

-job prioritization

-managing print jobs

  
  

**setting up a print server:**

  

server manager:

- print and document services
- internet printing

  

print management mmc

- add server (r+click print servers > add)
- add printer (r+click DC1 > add)
    
    - search the network for printers (if already printers on network)
    - add a tcp/ip ... (new on network)

  

adding printer to client

- [\\DC1\](file:///\\DC1\)
- r+click > connect (downloads drivers, properties and network location)

  

sharing:

- r+click printer > properties
- sharing > list in directory checked

  

printer pooling:

- single printer connected to multiple print devices
- for high volume

  

priority printing:

- setup 2 or more printers to a single print device
- 1 lowest, 99 highest

  

printer properties: still applied in AGDLP (accounts, global group, domain local, permissions)

print - start, cancel, pause, and resume their own docs | in everyone group

manage this printer - control properties and policies on the printer as well as everything else | IT guys

manage documents - control any documents in the print queue they want | team leads

  

IPP - internet printing protocol

- can print to URL (uniform resource locator) via HTTP
- can install a printer from inter/intranet

  
  

Windows Backups:

why:

- data integrity
    
    - corrupted files
    - deleted files
- data we're not using but need (archiving)
    
    - historical
    - legal
    - cover your ass

  

Windows backup feature:

- server manager > features > windows server backup
- backup schedule (top right)
  

  

full server is everything, once in a while

data only, daily/hourly

  

- backup to dedicated disk

  

forcing backups:

- backup once wizard
- scheduled backup options > select schedule

  

Recovering Data:

- recovery wizard > "this server"
- know when last good version of data was
- recovery type > a single file/folder or the whole volume (ex. G:)
- everything should be back in working order

  
  

**full backup - default**

advantages

- fast data recovery
- stores the whole ass drive so it wont disappear

disadvantages

- doing a full backup is slow
- need a ton of capacity to regularly do them

  

**incremental backup**

advantages

- backing up is fast, only the changed parts are backed up
- less storage
- can be run hella without much consequence

disadvantages

- slow restore (has to go way back then reiterate through changes)
- everything needs to not be corrupt

  

performance settings:

- this is where you change full / incremental backup

  

**storage media:**

magnetic tape - (Linear Tape-Open) LTO

- put them in libraries/vaults,
- hold up to 30tb data, sit offline safely

  

network attached storage (NAS) - on prem

- anywhere with data to be stored (on prem)
- high capacity high speed storage (directly to LAN)

  

off-prem:

- co-locate (aka a dedicated hosting place in your city/prov)
- another office in company

  

cloud - off prem

- saved to cloud!
  
  

  
  

**GPOS**

important Hive keys:

- HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE - settings for current computer
- HKEY_CURRENT_USER - settings for each profile
- HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG - info gathered at boot

  

Windows Registry:

**strings** contain **value data** - these are the 1's and 0's that control the computer

  

Group Policy Object (GPO)

- allows changing of value data for many users at a time

  

GPO is an object with a GUID like any other object in AD

- holds settings we can change
- on, off, not configured

can control everything that came with default windows

- ex. password complexity, length, time,
- wall papers | specific, none, customizable

  

GPOS need to be linked to something: (CAN BE LINKED TO MULTIPLE THINGS)

- **can be linked to local machine, site, domain, or OU**

  

Making/Editing GPOS

- r+click site, domain, or OU > create linked GPO

or

- r+click GPO > properties
  

  

**Default GPO**s

- Default **Domain** Policy
    
    - linked to **domain**, affects everything in domain
    - only ever change password policy section (IF ANYTHING)
- Default **Domain Controller**
    
    - linked to **domain controllers**, effects all DC's but nothing else (nothing inside)
    - domain controller OU default has **block inheritance**

  

local security policies:

- these are separate but do the same thing as GPOs
- only applied to local system
- **exists even if it's not connected to anything**

  

best practices:

- never make an uberGPO
- larger amount of smaller GPOS better than a few super GPOs
- name scheme:
    
    - U_<stuff> | for user accounts
    - C_<stuff> | for computer accounts
    - CU_<stuff> | for computer & user accounts

  
  

How do GPOs get applied:

  

Computers:

- when a computer authenticates with AD > downloads GPOs & applies
- does this during the white loading bubbles

Users:

- when a USER authenticates, all GPOs that apply download & apply
- user gets to desktop when GPOs are **FINISHED LOADING (after login)**
  

  

GPOS applied after startup and logon (computer vs user GPOS)

- refreshed every 90 mins (+/- 30 min offset) (so like every 77 minutes after first logon)
- 'GPupdate' in command prompt
- 'Invoke-GPUpdate' in powershell
    
    - 'Invoke-GPUpdate' for local machine
    - 'Invoke-GPUpdate -Computer "ISTNAIT\Client1" for remote

  

GPO ORDER:

LSDOU

  

Local Group (local computer)

Site

Domain

OUs

  

**THEY CAN OVERWRITE EACHOTHER THE FURTHER DOWN THEY GO**

  

**Policy inheritance**:

this is the cumulative effect of local site domain and ou policies (aka how they interact with eachother)

  

**Blocking Inheritance**:

- Default Domain Controllers OU has block inheritance on by default to protect OUs inside it
- Protects stuff underneath it
