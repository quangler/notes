OU = ISTAdmin (in AD users and computers)

To make admin:

Properties of account > members of > Domain Admins

  

Remoting in:

Server manager > add "Domain Admins" group to list of users allowed to connect to DC1

>should replicate to DC2

  

QuinnAdmin on AdminWS > launch Remote Desktop Connection Client

>show options > computer: **DC1.ISTNAIT.CA | Username: QuinnAdmin@istnait.ca** > allow me to save credentials > save on desktop (need password to use)

  

RSAT:

install it (or enable through control panel > programs > remote server administrator tools)

>should install the search bar folders of tools

>will need to click "add servers" on server manager when using RSAT (right click all servers, empty search, enter)

- click on a DC, then powershell in the server manager > doing commands from that server

  

Windows Admin Center:

>default settings through wizard > can only use for the machine you installed it on

>accept certificate ([https://localhost:6516](https://localhost:6516))

>add both DCs > click on a DC to connect, need to add extensions for AD, DNS, DHCP (go to top right cog > extensions)

>can add records, and use powershell from the servers

  

RealVNC:

Install server agent on DCs **not** adminws

>defaults on installer

adminws gets realVNC **viewer**

  

Creating users:

>QuinnUser > use this for everything, if you need admin priv > run as admin, enter credentials

>reset Bginfo

  

Templates:

>Set full name to something that will let you know it is a template

>set a password, change password on next logon, and account disabled

> (right click properties) fill in all the fields for a default 'whatever' user > set manager as QuinnAdmin

>copy > populate the new popup with whatever info it wants from you, set account to not disabled

  

>multiple users > highlight them > properties > fill in job specific details (still generalized)

  

Adding users with Powershell

>do it as admin

>[New-ADUser -Name "Lester Fundora" -GivenName "Lester" -Surname "Fundora" -SamAccountName "lfundora" -UserPrincipalName "lfundora@istnait.ca" -Path "OU=Instructors,OU=CNA,DC=ISTNAIT,DC=CA" -AccountPassword (Read-Host -AsSecureString "Type Password for the User Here") -Enable $True]

(no square brackets)

  

>Get-ADUser {name} to get info on the user & see if they were correctly made

  

Adding bulk users to AD

>need the .ps1 file and .csv file in the same place

>(right click open .ps1 file as notepad) can modify import location, or check where it is

>can open CSV file in excel to see what is going to be pulled

>put the .ps1 file and the .csv file on **DC1**

  

>in powershell on DC1 >navigate to the folder the powershell script will be executed (cd C:\IT)

>"./" means run script > ./Bulk_Users1.ps1

  

>if there are security errors: run these

>"Get-ExecutionPolicy"

>"Get-ExecutionPolicy -list"

>"Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted"

>"powershell.exe -executionpolicy -bypass"

>"Unblock-File -Path C:\Downloads\script.ps1"

(possible "PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass" or "PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted")

  

>users should be in their respective spots now

￼Organizing Users in groups:

>right click in a user group > new group > Global Security Group called students

>right click group > add users > type first name, check names

  

>make ISTAdmins global group in ISTAdmins OU and add QuinnAdmin to it, also IT_Template

  

Powershell: Making a group

>[New-ADGroup -Name "NET Students" -SamAccountName NETStudents -GroupCategory Security -GroupScope Global -DisplayName "NET Students" -Path "OU=Students,OU=NET,DC=ISTNAIT,DC=CA" -Description "Members of this Group are NET Students"]

(no square brackets)

  

Powershell: Adding users to a group

>[Add-ADGroupMember "NETStudents" -members {qparent}]

(no square brackets)

  

Creating a RAID array:

>add some drives to the VM (3 or more in example)

>default settings, (2GB drives, in one file, **not** allocated now)

>naming scheme - DC-RAID0, DC-RAID1, DC-RAID2

>login as QuinnAdmin > disk management

>change drives from offline to online (left side)

>right click > initialize > select all new disks

>right click > convert to dynamic disk > select only **new and unused drives**

>right click > New RAID-5 Volume

>assign drive letter, **NTFS and Quick Format**, rename volume

>this is software RAID

  

Creating a Home Folder Structure

>create a folder on DC2's new RAID drive (K:) called "DataHome"

>right click on "DataHome" > properties > advanced sharing

>check "share this folder" > permissions > remove "everyone" group

>add "authenticated users" > give them full control perms

  

test connection to the share:

>on adminws type in "[\\DC2\DataHome](file:///\\DC2\DataHome)"

(doesnt popup in the network section because the protocol is old and isnt being used anymore for "calling" the network shares)

  

Creating a Home Folder Structure pt 2.

>in AD users and computers > properties of a user > profile tab

>connect button at bottom > select a drive letter > [\\DC2\DataHome\%UserName%](file:///\\DC2\DataHome\%UserName%)

- this means that they will map the drive every time they login

>%UserName% will turn into the actual user's name

>select all users (not groups) > properties > profiles tab > connect > P: > [\\DC2\DataHome\%UserName%](file:///\\DC2\DataHome\%UserName%)

>this will make many subfolders in the DataHome folder (of usernames)

  

Configuring Windows Server Quotas:

By default the role is not installed

>DC2 > Roles Wizard > under File and Storage services > File Server Resource Management

>open File Server Resource Manager mmc > create quota (quota management > quotas > create quota)

>set quota path to K:\DataHome > custom properties > limit 10MB > hard quota

>if you go over the quota, you will get an error

  

Creating Global and Domain Local Groups: (AGDLP - Accounts, Global groups, Domain Local, Permissions)

Create the user accounts first > global groups > domain local groups > do the permissions for everything

￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼

  

Assigning Permissions:

>share top level folder - CorpData with Authenticated Users - full control as share permission

ex. structure - some users are set to ITDept, Accounting, Summer Students, Operations.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Folder Resource|Domain Local Group Assigned|Permission Assigned|
|K:\CorpData\Accounting|Accounting FC|Full Control|
|K:\CorpData\Databases|Database FC|Full Control|
||Database Read|Read|
|K:\CorpData\IT|ITDept FC|Full Control|
|K:\CorpData\Summer Student Projects|Summer Student Proj FC|Full Control|
||Summer Student Proj Read|Read|

**If any groups have "users" or "authenticated users" remove them****￼**only users with proper permissions should be able to access [\\DC2\CorpData\X](file:///\\DC2\CorpData\X)

  

Administrative and Hidden Shares:

(from adminWS) > Computer Management mmc (admin mode) > right click on computer management (local) > connect to DC2

>shared folders > "new share" > DC2 K:\Software

>make sure only admin group and system have access

>from [\\DC2\](file:///\\DC2\) you should see the shares

>rename the share to Software$ to hide the share > have to stop sharing the folder

>after the rename > advanced sharing > reshare it as Software$

>from [\\DC2\](file:///\\DC2\) you should **NOT** see the share

>to access the share, [\\DC2\Software$](file:///\\DC2\Software$) (or [\\DC2\$Software](file:///\\DC2\$Software)) I don't remember

  

>computer management mmc > Sessions and Open Files > you can see who has mapped out a drive and what they are currently accessing
