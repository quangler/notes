Telecommunication systems now include:

-Voice - VOIP

-Data

-Video - security cams, POE

-Access Control - who can access what

-Fire - fire alarms and such

-Security - door access, cameras

-Audio - intercoms

-Environmental - thermostats

-Smart building controls - lighting

Travel over copper, fibre, or wireless

Entrance Room (ER)

- entry point for outside plant (OSP); ISP cables, building cables
- may also serve as distributor room

  

Distributor Rooms (DC, DB, DA)

- common access point for cabling subsystems and building pathways
    
    - may contain: telecommunications equipment, cable terminations, associated cross-connect cabling.
- dedicated to telecommunications function (DON'T SHARE WITH ELECTRICAL)
- equipment not related to distributor room stuff shall not be in there (no piping, ductwork, pneumatic tubing)
  

  

Common requirements for rooms

General Architecture:

- ceiling height min = 3m
- no exterior windows
- temp = 5-35c
- only telecommunications equipment is permitted (no piping, ductwork, pneumatic tubing)
- fire protection -based on code

Racks and Cabinets:

- no taller than 2.1m
- minimum of 1m clearance in front and min of 0.6m behind
- cabinets should be adjustable front and back to provide 42 or more rack mount units
- power strips should be used

Rack Measurements:

- Rack Units: "U"s (1U=1.75 inch)
- full rack 42U = 73.2 inch, top and bottom makes height 6'10
- 2 post rack - telecommunications, routers/switches (things that donâ€™t go very deep)
- 4 post rack - servers, need back 2 posts for support due to weight

  

Distributor Room Enclosures:

- distributor enclosure > case/housing designed to contain components of DA, DB, or DC
- close as possible to center of area served
- minimum of 500 lux of light
- minimum of one 120V/20A electrical outlet

  

Utility Columns (pack poles)

- extend from ceiling to work area > provide pathways for wire and cables
- useful for renovations, or concrete flooring, open floor plan
  

  

Equipment Outlet (EO) Requirements:

- telecom outlet or MUTOA (multi-user telecommunications outlet assembly)
- min of one EO space shall be provide
- two separate outlets should be provided in difficult to reach areas (future proofing)
- bend radius should not be violated behind outlets

  

Access floor systems:

- aka raised flooring or low-profile flooring (same as drop ceiling but floor)
- floor that makes a space between two floors for mechanical and electrical services
- cool air can come up through floor for cooling servers, hot aisle & cool aisle

  

Underfloor Ducting / induct flooring

- slightly raised flooring to add cabling under the floor
- power, data, phone
- usually in office spaces due to needs of power and data near desks
  

  

Building Pathways - General

- not in elevator shafts
- install in dry locations that are within normal operating range of indoor cable
- firestop should be used for all penetrations of cables, wires, and pathways

  

Overhead Installation (drop/suspended ceilings)

- cable trays, ladder racks, and raceways are less expensive than a raised floor
- fits more easily and occupies less floor space
- makes circulating air within the data center harder (harder to push cold air down)

Overhead Open Raceways and Trays

- open architecture allows for cable to be placed from above,
- cable trays / open raceways / runways - make it easy, ladder style for copper dropdowns
- yellow "slides" for fibre usually
- conduit - a pipe looking structure that protects cable while passing through floors or walls, usually put in when building is being constructed
- electrical and communication cables should never share a conduit
- 50% max capacity

  

Perimeter Raceways (just a cable raceway)

-surface mounted pathways : contain Eos

-installed baseboard, chair-rail, ceiling height

  

Firestopping

- holes in walls & floors & ceilings represent a threat for the spread of fire
- Fireproof cable transit sleeves are added to seal conduit up while allowing cables through
