Helps keep things organized, has notes on issues & attempted solutions

- tracks events and failures, service requests and issue reports
- past resolutions can be stored so you can see old solutions

  

**Organization:**

- better than sending emails and them getting lost
- handle and maintain increased load
- assign tickets appropriately to IT groups
- find commonality - bang out a couple at a time
- incidents and requests classification (?)
  

  

**Efficiency:**

- respond to requests with much less effort
- fewer hours to take care of all customers
- fewer mistakes
- grateful customers - don't have to ask your name and email or whatever every time

  

**Speed:**

- usually expect their requests to be answered quickly
- with organization and efficiency > things move more quickly and smoothly
- less support staff needed
  

  

**Routing Options:**

- allow customer to select topic
- route ticket to a specific support staff who may be more knowledgeable about that topic
- staff can re-route tickets to another support staff

  

**Professionalism:**

- shows you are more professional, keep customers
- outdated support systems are old and seen as unprofessional
- a ticket management system is seen as new and forward thinking - expected now dog
- customers will definitely appreciate the trustworthy feeling of your support system - at least they know you will get to it and wont forget about it
  

  

**Automated Updates to Customers:**

- when you give updates to customers it makes them worry less and less likely to reach out or start a new ticket

  

**Records of Previous Communications:**

- lets you see what has happened in the past

  

**Statistics and Analytics Possibilities:**

- lets you know what your average response time is
- how many tickets you used
- gives you proof of people working, also can show business clients that things are going smoothly
- customer satisfaction is also here
  

  

**Queueing and Prioritization:**

- gets set as a queue in order
- prioritization is set as how much of your stuff isn't working - less stuff working = more prioritization (probably)
  

  

**Disadvantages of Ticketing Systems:**

- need infrastructure
- maintenance
- requires licensing/support (hella expensive)
- staff training - if they don't know how to use it, it isn't worth it

  

**Ticket Life:**

- new
- in progress
- on hold
- resolved
- closed

or

- canceled
