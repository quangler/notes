Creating VMs with an existing VHD File:

- create new VM wizard

- select "use an existing virtual disk"

  

why import/export vms?

- if you want to transfer a vm that is not a part of your cluster

  

Hyper-V Export

- you can take a vm out, comes with all data and settings

- you can use it to archive a VM too or make it an AD-HOC backup

  

Hyper-V Import

- allows you to recover VMs which were exported

  

Backing Up and Restoring VMs

- back em all up

- use a third party software in the real world (veeam, altaro)

  

- windows server backup will **not** backup VMs in a **cluster environment**
