Physical Data Center:

- lame as hell, hard to maintain/administer

  

Virtual Infrastructure:

- dope as hell, easier to maintain/administer (all your servers are on one guy)
- gives a pool of resources that you can manage virtually rather than just having what you have

  

Benefits of using VMs

- easy to move - just copy the file bro
- easy to manage - how is hardware gonna fail if it aint even there in the first place?

  

intro to VMware vSphere:

- suite of software for virtualization
    
    - ESXi, vCenter Server

  

**Hypervisor Function:**

abstracts the host PC's resources and allows them to be allocated to multiple VMs

  

ESXi:

- high security
- small disk footprint
- installable on basically anything (usb drive even)

  

You can manage ESXi hosts directly or from a vCenter Server (or CLI)

You can also move VMs from VMware to ESXi
