**(Total Cost of Ownership) TCO Calculator** (use when comparing cloud to on-prem)

- Compares your projected cloud costs with on prem estimates
- TCO calculator involves 3 steps:
    
    - Define your workload
    - Adjust your assumptions
    - View your report

  

**Pricing Calculator**

- Projects your cloud costs based on IaaS
- Two-step process:
    
    - Define your workloads - all your cloud resources
    - View your report
- No on-prem comparison
  

  

**Cost saving measures**

- Azure advisor
- Spending limits
- Reserved instances
- Lower cost locations / regions
- Resize underutilized VMs
- Deallocate VMs during off hours
- Migration from Iaas to PaaS offerings - look into for proj #important
- Azure hybrid benefit

  

**Service Level Agreement - SLA**

**SLA**

- an agreement between the subscriber and the provider providing IaaS, PaaS and or SaaS offerings

**Why do they matter?**

- Downtime for businesses costs thousands of dollars an hour
- SLAs relate to your total uptime as agreed

  

**Service Credits**

- Service credits are reimbursed according to uptime percentages in SLA for that service (this is only if you experience downtime)

SQL ex.

< 99.99% = 99.99% = 10

< 99% = 25

< 95% = 100 - free!

  

**Composite SLA**

When you build solutions in azure you combine SLAs ------> #important

Know this for the test

  
  

**Service lifecycles**

- The service lifecycle defines how every Azure service is released for public user
- Every azure service starts in the development phase. In this phase the azure team collects and defines its requirements, and begins to build the service.
- Next the service is released to the public preview phase. During this phase, the public can access and experiment with it and provide real-world feedback
- After a new azure service has been validated and tested, it's released to all customers as a production-ready service. This is known as general availability (GA)
- Things are not guaranteed to make it to GA
- Deployments using preview are only recommended for testing purposed - not production.
- Azure updates allow admins and organization to stay on top of new products, services, features, and product road maps.

  

The thing to be worried about is if your company heavily relies on a public preview. #important

- These things can just disappear, and aren't guaranteed to make it to GA.
