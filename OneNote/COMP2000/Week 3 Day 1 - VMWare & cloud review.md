**VMWare review**

  

**port groups** - allows for segmentation for layer 3 addresses, allows for VLAN and VLAN ID

**distributed switch** - centralization of virtual switches, meaning creating a switch in a vCenter server that is distributed to all the hosts

**what is a vKernel switch used for** - vMotion - live migration of VMs, IP storage - iscsi storage, vSAN - hyperconvergence

  

ESXI = free visor, limited functionality (no vMotion, linked clones, auto updates)

vSphere = a product suite that includes ESXi, vCenter, and other components

- licensing models can be expensive - no you cannot use pirated versions in industry

  

vCenter - management console

- preloaded with database and all appropriate functionality, limited in regards of host and VM support
- needs to use a handful of open ports

  

**Cloud computing review**

  

**what is a cloud** - cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing services

  

**why do we want to use the cloud** - flexibility, scalability (up and down), pay as you go, reduce your hardware, better uptime, availability/reliability

  

**cloud types**

- private cloud: dedicated cloud services used exclusively by individual subscribers
- public cloud: shared cloud services used by a group of subscribers
- hybrid: any combination of private or public cloud computing and/or on prem computing services

  

**PaaS:** platform as a service - an example is SQL as a service

- used to run applications
- don't need to worry about OS or server
- with some PaaS there is zero configuration required
  

  

**SaaS:** software as a service - netflix, m365

- applications that are hosted in which you subscribe to
- no need for servers or worrying about OS

  

**IaaS:** infrastructure as a service -

- your computing or networking infrastructure as a subscription
- you still need to worry about server OS / path levels
- networking can use provider built in networking or virtualized hardware
