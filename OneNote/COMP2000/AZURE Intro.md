**IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service**

infrastructure virtualized

you maintain it

  

**PaaS - Platform as a Service****ï¿¼**Platform virtualized (SQL, IOT, AI)

they maintain it, you back it up

  

**SaaS - Software as a Service**

software hosted for your use (O365, GSuite, facebook)

they maintain it, you should back it up

  

**Cloud models:**

  

**Public Cloud**

you don't own it, cloud provider owns it

  

**Private Cloud**

you own it all, self hosted

  

**Hybrid Cloud** #important

best of both worlds,

IaaS, PaaS, SaaS options

  
  

**Why use the cloud?**

- on premise has a lot of hidden costs.
    
    - (hardware, maintenance, training, hiring people, power, cooling)
- scalability needs to remain flexible - biggest component
    
    - on cloud you just add some extra power,
    - on prem you need to build a new server or upgrade.

  

**Is cloud computing cheaper? Yes & No**

- cloud computing typically is marketed to be cheaper then on prem.
- cloud computing is typically a pay-as-you-go pricing model.
- in **most** cases this is cheaper compared to on prem
- what if you over spec a VM in the cloud? - paying for something you aren't using

  

**What is Azure?**

- Microsoft's cloud computing platform
- Azure is the umbrella container for Microsoft's IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
- Azure is continually expanding its set of cloud services to meet organization's needs
- In its infancy Azure was just cloud-based storage, VM storage and hosted M365.

  

**What can I do with Azure?**

- Use hundreds of different services to run existing apps, new software deployments, AI, bots, mixed reality, etc.
- Starting point is using M365, and moving some VMs to the cloud
- migration of on prem VMs is a good starting point

  

**How does Azure work?** - azure loves containerization

- Azure uses virtualization to support its entire platform.
- Azure hypervisors provide a virtual space for VMs/platforms to run
- these hypervisors are distributed in datacenters that are worldwide
- Azure uses fabric controls and orchestrators to control everything inside of Azure
- everything we do in azure is done through Web API - do this through the azure portal.
- can also interact with Azure through Azure market place

  

**What is Azure used for?**

Compute service, cloud, networking, app hosting, AI, internet of things, integration, security

  

**Azure Accounts:**

- this is where it all starts
- to create an account you need a subscription

  

Your Azure account has a subscription that links it to a resource group, then that resource group has different resources in it.

  

Account - > subscription - > resource group - > resources (webapp, SQL server, etc.)
