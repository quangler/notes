IEEE 802.11 - original wireless standard

  

- mobility
- access to network in more areas (public spaces, remote areas)
- connectivity to an organizations infrastructure - point to point antennas (think LTT)
- deployment - network cabling could be difficult / super costly in some places

  

- security - broadcasting in open air, unauthorized users could get in, rogue APs
- Radio signal interference
- coverage range - low quality for long distances
- slow speed compared to wired

  

Wireless: all types of devices and tech not connected by wire

Wireless Communications: transmission of digital data without using wires

  

- Bluetooth

- low-power, short range wireless data and voice transmissions
    
    - WirelessHD - high frequency
- proprietary standard, used for wireless transmission of HD video and audio on ultra wide band
- theoretically 25Gbps
    
    - Satellite - using satellites
- transmit data over long distance
    
    - Cellular - using cell towers
- High-speed, high-capacity voice and data communication network
- used for cell phones, also used for internet access, or WAN failover
    
    - Fixed broadband wireless communications
- point to point antennas that broadcast signals long distance
    
    - Wi-Fi based wireless LANs
- extension of a wired LAN, connected via wireless AP
- Access Point - network device that allows other wi-fi devices to connect to a wired network
- Wireless network interface card (NIC) - has an antenna built in
- Enterprise WLAN - designed for better security, performance, centralized management/config, and user experience
  

**Standards Organizations**

- responsible for **global** management of radio frequency spectrum
- work with regional/local entities (like the Federal Communications Commission or FCC in USA)

  

- Industry Canada regulates the wireless LAN devices use of the RF spectrum in Canada
- There are 5 regions (A-E)

  

- created the OSI model for data communications

- creates standards for compatibility and coexistence between networking equipment
- these standards are written documents describing how technical processes and equipment should function
- IEEE 802.11 defines communication mechanisms only at the **Physical layer & MAC sublayer of OSI**
  

- responsible for creating internet standards, lots of them are integrated into the wireless networking and security protocols and standards.

  

- responsible for performing certification testing on wireless equipment
- they do the testing and give devices the stamp of approval (they are the WIFI symbol)

The International Telecommunication Union Radio Communication Sector (ITU-R)

  

Most countries have their own orgs that are like the FCC that regulate **licensed and unlicensed spectrum**.
