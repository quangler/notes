Why RF Math:

- required to determine whether your RF link is compliant with power limitations set by regulatory bodies (ISED/FCC)
- each rf component affects the output of the transceiver

  

**Components of RF communications:**

- transmitter
- intentional radiator (IR)
- equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP)
- antenna
- receiver
- isotropic radiator

  

transmitter:

- initial component in creation of wireless medium
- begins generating AC signal
- AC signal determines frequency of transmission and oscillates accordingly
- takes data and modifies the AC signal using modulation to encode data into signal
- sends modulated signal to antenna directly or through a cable

  

intentional radiator (IR):

- device specifically designed to generate and radiate RF signals
- includes all hardware from the transmitter up to **but not including** the antenna - (RF device [transmitter/receiver], cabling, connectors)
- FCC/ISED limit the amount of power that is allowed to be generated by the IR

  

antenna:

- collects modulated AC signal from the transmitter
- directs/radiates RF waves away from the antenna in a pattern specific to the antenna type
- captures the RF waves
- passes the AC signal to the receiver, which converts AC to bits and bytes

  

- as a reference, RF transmission of an antenna is compared to an isotropic radiator (perfect antenna)

  

receiver:

- final component in wireless signaling
- converts carrier signal from antenna into 1's and 0's
- receive amplitude (strength) is weaker than transmit amplitude

  

**Basic RF Math:**

**equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP)** - the power radiated by the antenna element

- what is regulated by ISED in Canada and FCC in US
- they define maximum power output for IR and maximum EIRP that radiates from antenna
- transmit power of most indoor WLAN radios varies in a range between 1mW and 100mW
- transmit power of 4 watts is allowed to be radiated from an antenna in a point to multipoint application (outside)

  

**RF units of power and units of comparison**

units of power (absolute) - used to measure transmission and received amplitude

- **Watts (W) - 1A*1V (one amp at one volt)**
- **Milliwatts (mW) - 1/1000 of a watt | 1mW=0.001W**

most 802.11 devices use between 1mW-100mW

APs are generally 30-100mW

- **decibels relative to 1 milliwatt (dBm)**

  

units of comparison (relative) - often used to measure how much gain or loss occurs because of cabling or antennas, or a difference in power.

- **decibel (dB) - specifically designed to measure power gain or loss | 1dB = 1/10 of a bell**

often used to compare power to 2 transmitter or more, or difference/loss between EIRP output of a transmitter's antenna and amount of power received by receiver's antenna

- **decibels relative to an isotropic radiator (dBi)**
- **decibels relative to a half-wave dipole antenna (dBd)**

  

**Calculating gain and loss:**

- rules of 10s and 3s (dBm and mW)

  

3 dB of gain (relative) = 2x the absolute power (mW) #remember-for-later

  

3 dB of loss (relative) = /2 the absolute power (mW) #remember-for-later

  

10 dB of gain (relative) = 10x the absolute power (mW) #remember-for-later

  

10 dB of loss (relative) = /10 the absolute power (mW) #remember-for-later
