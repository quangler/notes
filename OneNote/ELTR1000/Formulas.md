- **RMS = 0.707** #important
- **V****RMS** **= V** **peak** **/ root(2)**
- **I****RMS** **= I** **peak****/root(2)**
- **V****RMS** **= V** **peak** *** 0.707**

  

**V1 = most significant bit**

**V****out** **= - (V****1** **+ V****2****/2 + V****3****/4 â€¦)**

  

**V****n** **/ 2****n-1** **is general formula**
