Static Electricity - imbalance of electrons between objects

- called static because the displaced electrons tend to remain stationary after being moved from one insulating material to another
- can cause damage to sensitive semiconductors in circuitry.

Grounding is how you can get rid of static electricity

Getting rid of static electricity

- ground yourself
- have clean air (air conditioning??)

  

**Conductors vs Insulators** #important

Conductor

- conductors allow electrons to move around freely
- some good conductors: copper, gold, iron, concrete, dirty water

Insulator

- insulators don't allow electrons to move around as freely
- insulators get hot from resistance
- some good insulators: glass, rubber, air, fibreglass, pure water

  

10 BASE T

10 mbps, baseband (as opposed to broadband), T - twisted pair

  

10 base 2

10 mbps, baseband, 200 meters

  

**Electron Flow**

- a controlled movement of electrons (rather than the typically random pattern of "free" electrons)
- this is what we call electricity or electrical current, could also be called dynamic electricity
- electrons require there to be a continuous path of conductive material to flow ( closed circuit ) #important
- needs a source & destination of power

  
  

**Alternating vs Direct Current**

Alternating

- flows in an alternating path (back and forth constantly)

Direct Current

- flows from source to destination, negative to positive
  

  

**Electric Circuit**

- a never ending loop that has a continuous flow of electrons

  

a continuous charge flow cannot occur **anywhere** in a broken circuit

  

**Voltage and Current**

voltage:

- what pushes the electrons, moves from point A to point B,
- the speed of electricity getting to you
- sources: batteries, solar cells, generators
- measured in volts (V)

  

current:

  

-   
    
- how much electricity gets to you
- measured in amperes
  

  

polarity matters - also known as potential direction

  

resistance can be linked to size of cable

  

**Ohm's Law** #important

- discovered by George Simon Ohm

need to know voltage, current, and resistance #important

- conductors have low resistance, and insulators have high resistance

  

the amount of current in a circuit depends on the amount of voltage and the amount of resistance in the circuit to oppose current flow

  

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|current|I|amp|A|
|voltage|E or V|volt|V|
|resistance|R|Ohm|omega|

  
  

conventional flow: positive to negative - this is what the OG scientists believed

electron flow: negative to positive - this is what happens in the real world

  

**Safety**

how to help someone that's been electrically shocked

- disconnect them from the source
- turn off the circuit (breaker) or hit them with an insulated stick
- give them medical attention
- heart troubles can continue after shock for hours

  

sources of hazard

- wet conditions increase the risk of electric shock by lowering skin resistance
- replace or repair damaged cables, the best way of preventing use is by cutting an end off.
- powerlines should be avoided - don't get out of your car, or hop on one foot

  

safe meter (tool) usage

- multimeter can check voltage, current, and resistance
- voltage is always relative between two points
- remember to set your tool to what you need (ac/dc, voltage/current/resistance)
- never try to read resistance or continuity with a multimeter on a circuit that is powered #important
- current measuring meters (ammeters) are always connected in a circuit #important
