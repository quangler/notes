**Voltmeter** **(V)**

- an instrument for measuring electrical potential difference (Volts) between two points in an electric circuit.
- **the voltmeter is connected in** **parallel** **or** **across** **the device being measured** #important
- needs a power supply to be on

  

**Ammeter (A)**

- an instrument for measuring current (electrons) in a circuit.
- **the ammeter is connected in** **series** **or** **in-line** **with the circuit so the current passes through the ammeter** #important
- remember to turn the probe into the current one

  

**Ohmmeter (Ohms)**

- an instrument for measuring the resistance placed between its leads.
- **an ohmmeter does not need a power supply connected** #important
- you can measure the resistance in parallel or in series.
- the resistance reading is indicated through a digital meter which operates on electric current
- this meter can be used to ensure the continuity of the circuit (sufficient flow of current)
  

  

a multimeter is the best of all of them

digital is king baby

  

**Safety:**

- don't touch bare probe tips while measuring voltage
- always check for both AC and DC voltage
- never try to read resistance or continuity with a multimeter on an energized circuit.
