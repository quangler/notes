polarity changes rapidly on AC circuits

- this makes the polarity of devices connected irrelevant

  

the symbol for AC in a diagram is a circle with a wave in it

how to check if something is AC without knowing:

- use a multimeter
  

  

things that use AC

- homes, car alternators, radios, lots of electronics

  

AC advantages over DC

- generation / transmissions
- transformer voltage increase/decrease
- efficient power distribution and motors (compared to DC)

  

AC power is produced when the magnet is closest to the coils (this happens twice)

- the north pole = positive side of current generation

  

transformers use "mutual inductance" - which is when a coils changing magnetic field induces a voltage in another coil #important

(exchanging of energy from one coil to another)

  

^ very similar to a bike's gear system

  

step-down = high voltage / low current > high current / low voltage

  

step-up = high current / low voltage > high voltage / low current

  

transformers only work with AC #important

- done to step up or down voltage

  

low current - high voltage : can be used over thinner wires over long distance

- you then need to step the voltage down for more current

  
  

AC Waveform characteristics

- sine wave
- square wave
- triangular wave

  

Measuring AC

- **root mean square (RMS) - measuring AC to the equivalent in DC** #important
- 10v AC RMS = 10v DC
- 10v AC =/= 10v DC
- **RMS = 0.707** #important
- **V****RMS** **= V** **peak** **/ root(2)**
- **I****RMS** **= I** **peak****/root(2)**
- **V****RMS** **= V** **peak** *** 0.707**

  

- peak of a square wave lasts way longer than triangle or sign wave,
- so RMS measures the average heat of the wave
