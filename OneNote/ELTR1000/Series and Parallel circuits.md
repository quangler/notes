**Series Circuit**

- only one path for current to flow
- connected in a daisy-chain (end to end)
  

  

current: the amount of current is the same throughout any component in a series circuit #important

  

resistance: the total resistance of any series circuit is equal to the sum of individual resistances

  

voltage: the supply voltage in a series circuit is equal to the sum of the individual voltage drops

  
  

**Parallel Circuit**

- all components are connected between the same set of electrically common points
- all components are connected across each other's leads
  

  

voltage: voltage is equal across all components in a parallel circuit #important

  

current: the total circuit current is equal to the sum of the individual branch currents

  

resistance: individual resistances diminish to equal a smaller total resistance rather than add to make the total
