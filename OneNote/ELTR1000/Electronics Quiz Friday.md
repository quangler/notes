List a few objects in a building that are considered to be an ideal area for good electrical grounding/bonding?

- Grounding wires, pipes (metal)
- Bus bar

Grounding :

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Grounding points are good (?)

  

Transformer has more coils on one side than the other (small to large transformer - or something)

  

Transformers - high voltage over the power lines, low amperage - transformer makes this do it

It either steps up the voltage or steps down the voltage

  
  

Why was AC chosen to be the preferred choice for the Electrical PowerGrid?

Efficient for transmitting current over a longer distance

The ability to step up and step down current

Smaller wires can be used

AC Generator are consider to be more efficient than DC

**All of the above -**

  
  

**Rectifier = AC>DC**

**Inverter = DC>AC**

  

**Online ups - constantly using the battery for power**

**Standby up - switches to battery power if it needs it**

  

120AV uses 14 gauge wire

  

RMS - AC constantly changes - takes the average of AC power equivalent of dc power

  

What is peak voltage of 120V AC supply - 170V (know how to do these calculations)

  
  

difference between AC and DC

AC - current flows in one direction then another

- magnet surrounded by coils - generates power twice per rotation

  

DC - current flows in a single direction

- coil surrounded by magnets - generates power constantly while spinning

  

how is AC current generated

- A magnet is spun between two coils (creates current twice per 360 degree rotaion)

- known as Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction

  

importance of stepping up/down AC current

- it is much easier to do with AC than DC

- can step voltage up so you can send it across thinner lines further distances (without having to worry about the resistance and thickness of wire like if you had high current)

-

  

AC current advantages over DC

- can be stepped up and down

- easier / cheaper to generate

  

how AC wave is produced

- usually expressed in SIN wave

  

mutual induction is produced by transformer (coil inducing another coil with voltage)

  

AC voltage / current is not stable - DC voltage / current is

  

10V AC RMS is equivalent to 10V DC - same amount of heat dissipation across a resistor

* - for sine wave it is about 0.707*peak

  

P= E^2/R and P = I^2/R

  

RMS = "DC Equivalent" to any AC voltage or current

  
  

Rectifier = AC to DC power

  

Inverter = DC to AC power

  

Online UPS = constantly charging battery and using that as the power for the devices

  

Standby UPS = utility power is used until power outage is detected, then battery is used for power (a few milliseconds of AC output)
