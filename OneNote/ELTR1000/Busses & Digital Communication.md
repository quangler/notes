**Bus -** two or more digital devices being connected together so that data can be communicated between them.

  

Fieldbus or Profibus - not just physical wiring of bus, also specify voltage levels for communication, timing sequence, connector pinout specs, and all other distinguishing features of the network.

  

Busses are the things that connect the wires and convert the language so that the two things can speak to each other.

- Ex. 2 CAN bus devices can communicate

  

Two types:

**Short distance busses:**

- Ex. PC/AT Bus - used in early IBM-compatible PCs to connect peripherals
- PCI - another bus MUCH faster than PC/AT - 100Mbytes/sec (32bit), 200Mbytes/sec (64bit)
- PCMCIA - bus designed for connecting peripherals to laptops
- SCSI - an alternative bus used for personal computer disk drives
  

  

**Extended distance network:**

- Ex. 20 mA current loop: digital communications network based on interrupting a 20 mA current loop to represent binary
- RS-232C: most common serial network used in computer systems - often for peripherals
- RS-422A/RS-485: better version of RS-232C - more range - less noise
- Ethernet (IEEE 802.3): ethernet
- Token ring: ethernet competitor way back in the day, allowed for more precise response times from individual network devices
- Modbus/Modbus plus: originally implemented by Modicon corporation, a large maker of PLCs (programmable logic controllers) fo linking remote I/O (input/output) racks with a PLC processor
